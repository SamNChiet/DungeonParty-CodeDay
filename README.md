# DungeonParty
Dungeon Party is an unlimited-player procedural dungeon crawler similar to the Binding of Isaac. Players connect locally using their phones as gamepads. It was built in ~15 hours at CodeDay LA

#How to Play
To get started, install and run [HappyFunTimes](http://superhappyfuntimes.net/install) on your computer. After you've loaded the Intro.scene file within Unity, have each player connect to the same Wi-Fi as the machine running the game and navigate to happyfuntimes.net on their phones. Their character should appear on the screen and the gamepad should appear on their phone. Happy adventuring!

Use the directional pad to move and the right button to shoot. The player shoots in a sequence of (up,down,left,right). This was done to circumvent the inaccurate multitouch with dual directional pads.

#Plans
There is currently no endgame, so I plan to add a final boss to the floor and expand the number of rooms that can be generated.
